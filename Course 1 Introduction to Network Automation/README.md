# Introduction to Network Automation Course Syllabus

## Course Description

The Network infrastructure industry has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with an increasing need for automation due to factors such as a demand for faster and more reliable network deployments. Therefore, there is a growing need for network engineers skilled in automation and programmability.

This course is primarily intended for network engineers, systems engineers, network architects, and managers interested in learning the fundamentals of network automation.

To be successful in this course, you should be proficient in fundamental network routing & switching technologies, understand the basics of Python programming (3-6 mos exp.), and have some familiarity with Linux.

## Learning Objectives: 
By the end of this course, you will be able to: 

- Articulate the role network automation, and programmability plays in the context of end-to-end network management and operations.

- Interpret Python scripts with fundamental programming constructs built for network automation use cases

## Introduction to Network Automation
By the end of each week, you will be able to:

## Week 1:
- Define what Device Level and Controller Level Programmability and Management are and compare the use cases for each one as they relate to network automation.

- Describe the model-driven programmability stack and data modeling.

- Describe the underlying problem statement with regard to network management and operations.

- Describe how Cisco has enabled nearly every core platform with APIs for modern network operations.

- Articulate key use cases for network automation and understand that automation is greater than deploying configurations faster.

- Comprehend the breadth and depth of APIs across Cisco technologies and the value that provides to enhanced network automation.

## Week 2: 
- Describe how Python modules enable modular development

- Describe how the Netmiko Python library can be used to automate network devices over SSH

- Articulate the role of PyPI and pip along with how to install Python applications from source

- Compare and contrast Python modules and packages

- Interpret basic scripts using constructs such as data structures, conditional blocks, and loops
